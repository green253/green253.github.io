by the Landlord or an acceptance, an agreement to accept the surrender of said premises, unless the same is evidence by an instrument in writing which is signed 
by the Landlord. The acceptance of delivery of the keys for the Leased Premises by the Landlord prior to the date of Lease termination as provided for in

right to re-enter and repossess the premises, to remove all persons therefrom and to remove all property therefrom and in each event this Lease and all rights 
of the Tenant as Tenants shall terminate, but the Tenant shall remain liable for the rent herein specified during the remaining term of this Lease plus Landlord’s 
cost of repossessing the premises. Tenant hereby waives notice of any failure or default and of any demand by Landlord for possession of the premises. In the event 
Landlord shall repossess the premises, Landlord shall not be required to exercise diligence in re-letting the premises in order to mitigate Tenant’s obligations hereunder,
nor will it be required to accept any Tenant for the premises offered by Tenant. The failure on the part of the Landlord to re-enter or repossess the premises, 
or to exercise any of its rights hereunder, upon default, shall not preclude the Landlord from the exercise of such rights during the continuance of such default 
or upon any subsequent default. Acceptance of past due rent will in no way act as a waiver of Landlord’s right to terminate the Lease for non-payment of rent when due, 
and no notice or demand shall be required for the enforcement thereof. If Tenant shall violate or breach the terms of this Lease, the Tenant shall pay all cost and expenses, 
including attorneys fees, incurred by Landlord in connection with exercising any rights or remedies it may have under this Lease because of such violation or breach. </p>
